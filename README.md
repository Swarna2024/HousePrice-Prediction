# HousePrice-Prediction
California HousePrice Prediction Project

🏡 Overview

This project predicts California housing prices using machine learning models. The dataset is sourced from the California Housing Dataset available in sklearn.datasets. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and comparison of different regression models.
